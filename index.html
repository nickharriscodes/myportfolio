    <!--ABOUT ME-->
    <div class="container">
            
        <h1 class="page-header">About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I’m a web developer, <a href="https://rickymirage.bandcamp.com/">musician</a>, cyclist, and plant dad based in Chicago, Illinois. I graduated from Loyola University Chicago in 2013 with a BA in English, and since then I have worked as a copywriter, retail shift manager, music teacher, among other things, all the while writing music and recording with several different bands. <br><br>I started learning about web development a little over a year ago when I received a Google Challenge Scholarship to complete a FrontEnd-focused Nanodegree with Udacity.  Since completing my studies with Udacity, I have continued feeding my curiosity and passion for learning by self-teaching using the boundless resources of the Internet. Most recently, I have begun working as an apprentice with <a href="https://thedifferenceengine.io">The Difference Engine</a>, a Chicago based-non profit that builds websites and IT solutions for other low/no-budget non-profits while giving experience to new developers from non-traditional backgrounds. We're currently working on a recipes app for Rescuing Leftover Cuisine, an organization dedicated to reducing food waste. <br><br>Below you’ll find a few links to live examples of my best work thus far. Thanks for stopping by my site. Let's build something cool together - be sure to reach out and say hi!</p>

                <p>This is a demo version of the recipes-sharing app I have been working on with The Difference Engine. We utilize <strong>React.js</strong> on the front end and <strong>PostgresQL and Ruby on Rails</strong> on the server-side to run this <a href="https://github.com/the-difference-engine/rescue-leftover-cuisine2">open source</a> full-stack application. I have used <strong>Git version control</strong> extensively and followed the <strong>Agile Methodology </strong>on this project.</p>

                <p>This application is a fun card-matching memory game that I created while working on my Udacity Nanodegree. I built out all of the <strong>dynamic functionality</strong> of this game — the “flipping” cards, matching logic, scoring, timer — using <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>, and it helped me solidify some fundamental concepts like <strong>object-oriented programming, version control, scope</strong>, and more. </p>

                <p>This is the official website for the Chicago-based alternative rock band Young Man in a Hurry, which will release its debut album in 2019. A mostly informational website built using <strong>bootstrap</strong> for enhanced styling, this website is used as a promotional tool by the band. I collaborated with <a href="https://hartfordesign.com/">Hartford Design</a> and the client and responded to feedback to create this page.</p>

                <p>An app I built as a learning-project in order to work with the <strong>Google Books API</strong>. The query entered in the search box returns a list of books and corresponding information which has been <strong>filtered from a JSON object using jQuery</strong>. There are various <strong>user-friendly</strong> ways to clear the results and run a new search. This app was also subject to a <strong>code review</strong> from an industry professional, and revised and improved in response to that review. </p>
