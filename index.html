    <!--ABOUT ME-->
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="page-header">About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I’m a web developer, <a href="https://rickymirage.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">musician</a>, 
            cyclist, and plant dad based in Chicago, Illinois. I graduated from Loyola University Chicago 
            in 2013 with a BA in English, and since then I have worked as a copywriter, retail shift manager, 
            music teacher, among other things, all the while writing music and recording with several 
            different bands. 
            <br><br>
            I started learning about web development in 2018 when 
            I received a Google Challenge Scholarship to complete a FrontEnd-focused Nanodegree with Udacity.  
            After completing my studies with Udacity, I undertook a volunteer apprenticeship with
             <a href="https://thedifferenceengine.io" target="_blank">The Difference Engine</a>, 
            a Chicago based-non profit that builds websites and IT solutions for other low/no-budget non-profits 
            while giving experience to new developers from non-traditional backgrounds. We created a recipe-sharing 
            app for Rescuing Leftover Cuisine, an organization dedicated to reducing food waste.  
            <br><br>
            Lately, I have been diving head first into open source development by volunteering 
            with an organization called <a href="https://greenstand.org" target="_blank">Greenstand</a>, 
            a non-profit devoted to creating a tech-based solution for the intersecting disasters of 
            deforestation, climate change, and extreme poverty in developing nations.
            <br><br>
            Below you’ll find a few links to live examples of my best work thus far. Thanks for stopping by my site. 
            Let's build something cool together - be sure to reach out and say hi!

                    This is a demo version of the recipes-sharing app I have been working on with The Difference Engine. 
                    We utilize <strong>React.js</strong> on the front end and <strong>PostgresQL and Ruby on Rails</strong> 
                    on the server-side to run this <a href="https://github.com/the-difference-engine/rescue-leftover-cuisine2" target="_blank">open source</a>
                     full-stack application. I have used <strong>Git version control</strong> extensively and followed
                      the <strong>Agile Methodology </strong>on this project.

                <p>
                    This application allows the user to grow as their plants grow by mapping some 
                    data for a group of plants to a calendar. Simply click a date on the calendar, and the 
                    application will display a list of plants that need to be watered on the selected day. I 
                    used <strong>React and Node</strong> with a little front end help from the <strong>Material UI</strong> 
                    framework. The plant data comes from an <strong>Express backend API deployed on Heroku.</strong>
                    Created for the 2019 Tandem Apprenticeship code challenge.

                    After realizing I was spending way to much time sifting through various job boards 
                    looking for my first web development job, I decided to create my own website which would pull 
                    job listings from other websites using their APIs, and sorting the results for the 
                    specific opportunities I was looking for. It uses <strong> React, Express, Redis as a database, 
                    Material UI, and is hosted on Digital Ocean</strong>. This website is still a work in progress!

                    This is the official website for the Chicago-based alternative rock band Young Man in a Hurry,
                     which will release its debut album in 2019. A mostly informational website built using 
                     <strong>bootstrap</strong> for enhanced styling, this website is used as a promotional 
                     tool by the band. I collaborated with <a href="https://hartfordesign.com/" target="_blank">Hartford Design</a> 
                     and the client and responded to feedback to create this page.

                    An app I built as a learning-project in order to work with the <strong>Google Books API</strong>. 
                    The query entered in the search box returns a list of books and corresponding information which has 
                    been <strong>filtered from a JSON object using jQuery</strong>. There are various 
                    <strong>user-friendly</strong> ways to clear the results and run a new search. This app was also 
                    subject to a <strong>code review</strong> from an industry professional, and revised and improved 
                    in response to that review.

                <p>This application is a fun card-matching memory game that I created while working on my 
                    Udacity Nanodegree. I built out all of the <strong>dynamic functionality</strong> of 
                    this game — the “flipping” cards, matching logic, scoring, timer — using <strong>vanilla 
                    JavaScript</strong>, and it helped me solidify some fundamental concepts like <strong>object-oriented 
                    programming, version control, scope</strong>, and more.
